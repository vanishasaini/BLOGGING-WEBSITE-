        </section>

<h3>
    
 <br>Today we are living in a world where competition is increasing everyday in several forms and we are expected to work with full potential to give our best and to be a very strong competitive personality to sustain. But what if you are not standing high as others…..? have you start believing that you are not meant for success..?
Relax…failing is not the end of this world neither the end of our capabilities and desires, also competition around you is not to force anyone to do anything but to motivate an individual to achieve desired goals.
Always remember the path travelled by less people is always difficult but you are even more stronger.
It is very obvious to be disheartened and demotivated at our failures but  If you are not able to move on with your failures and stuck in your life do not worry , Here are some of  the amazing  tips to cope up with failures.<br>
<br>

1.<b>ANALYZE THE SITUATION:</b>	 It is very important to analyze the situation and thinking of its severity and consequences. sometimes we tend to make the situation worse at our end by overreacting to it and got messed up in our thoughts. We don’t need to view our failures from others perspective.<br>
<br>

2.<b> ACCEPT THE FAILURE:</b> it is always a good practice to accept what has done and need to have a “what’s done is done attitude” to calm the situation and remembering of doing better next time. We have no powers to change the situation but we have power to change the future situation by our action.<br>
<br>
3.	<b> BE OPTIMISTIC:</b> being positive at failures tends to lesser our pain and boost our energy to perform better next time it is important to take some positive stress to stay motivated but going deeper down in negativity can cause some serious health issues.<br>
<br>
4.<b>RECOZNISE YOUR MISTAKE:</b>having a look to your mistakes that leads to the failure might help you to do better by getting know your past actions, also doing such thing will help you to come out with the guilt phase and you might cope up with the failure.<br>
<br>
5.<b>BE KIND TO YOURSELF:</b> you should not harm yourself in the name of so called depression and anxiety but to praise and appreciate yourself that you have at least try doing something irrespective of failing. consider yourself as the only strongest personality to prevail the failure.<br>
<br>
6.<b>MOVE FORWARD:</b> you should keep going and develop a let go attitude with the mark of satisfaction and the fire within to conquer the fear of failing in life. You need to learn not to stop at any setback of life but to surpass it with a new experience and a big smile.<br>
<br>
7.<b>LEARN FROM YOUR FAILURE:</b> last but not the least learning from our failures always offers a giant storage of experiences and bulk of ways to approach a problem to act in some direction with a new purpose.<br>
